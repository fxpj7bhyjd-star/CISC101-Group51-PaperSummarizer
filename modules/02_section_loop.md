**Module 2 — Section Loop**:

Process each section:

- Write 1–2 neutral summary sentences.
- Extract one bullet-point key takeaway.
- Copy every numbered equation exactly (Preserve LaTeX).
- Extract every citation key exactly as written.
- If summary_level = "short" -> generate only a compact summary (1-2 sentence summary per section).
- If summary_level = "detailed" -> generate summary + bullet list (a short paragraph plus a bullet list of 3-5 key points for each section).
