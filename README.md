Each part of this repository is important. As we can see, we have the system prompt, the README, and the modules. First, the system prompt shows us the rules and wath needs to be done. The README explains each component and its purpose; it also helps us navigate easier through the repository. The modules help break the components into different parts, making it easier to debug the system anf find where to make changes.
